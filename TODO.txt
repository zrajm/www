* TODO Incorrect indent in some cases                                   :BUG:
  Given two <div>s on the same level, the 'hanging' class affects both of them,
  even though it should only affect the latter. There's something fishy about
  how CSS variables function here, I think. :(

    ----------------------------------------
    <div>

    <div class=hanging>
    ----------------------------------------
* TODO Word-wrapping of PDF/external links icons
  Currently, when links are line-wrapped, the wrapping can occur between the
  link name and the icon that follows. This looks ugly, would it be better not
  to allow that?
* TODO CSS: 'rem' units give rounding errors
  There are rounding errors which makes stuff look irregular/ugly sometimes in
  Firefox (something that goes away when you zoom in). For example, the top and
  bottom margins get slightly different widths for the table cell overlay used
  to hilite links when there's only a single link in the cell.

  According to measurements obtained with:

    document.body.insertAdjacentHTML('afterbegin', '<div id=x style=background:#ff0>x')
    document.querySelector('#x').style.width = '1rem'
    document.querySelector('#x').clientWidth

  The following values are currently true (because 1rem = 20px):

  | ⅛ | .125rem | 2.5px = 3px (rounded) |
  | ¼ | .25rem  | 5px                   |
  | ½ | .5rem   | 10px                  |
  | ¾ | .75rem  | 15px                  |
  | 1 | 1rem    | 20px                  |

  Maybe add CSS variables for each measurement used, then set them to rounded
  values? For example:

  --rem       = 20px
  --half-rem  = 10px
  --quart-rem = 5px
  --eight-rem = 3px

  The following shell command lists all used 'rem' values used in 'scent.css':

    <scent.css R 's#<svg\b.*</svg>##g' G -o '[0-9.]+rem' U -c S -nk2

  This works in my customized Zsh, with the following global aliases in effect:

    alias -g G='|grep'
    alias -g R='|perl -Mutf8 -C -pE'
    alias -g S='|sort'
    alias -g U='|LC_ALL=C sort|uniq'
* TODO Table-of-content: Use bullet list with lines(?)

* TODO Table-of-content: Hanging indent
  Very long headings needs some indentation so as to not appear as two headings
  in the table-of-content.

  Maybe set '--is-hanging' in the table-of-content, and then use that for
  `<li>` tags as well?
* TODO Git commit hook verifying that date of 'Updated' header has changed
* TODO `quotecurl()` should be invoked on 'title' attributes too
* [0/3] Scroll shadow
** TODO Should be fully invisible when not needed
   Currently the shadow and the anti-shadow (that neutralizes the shadow when
   there's no more scrolling in that direction) do not completely cancel each
   other out, so that there is a 'ghost shadow' where there should be no shadow
   at all.
** TODO Transparent table background
   Currently tables have a background color, but is it possible to have a
   transparent background, and still use scroll shadows? (A transparent
   background would play nicer with the `:target` background coloring.)
** TODO Gradient scroll shadow?
   This article lists a live example at the end with a gradient scroll shadow,
   which looks kinda nice. Maybe adopt this?

* TODO Prettier scroll-to-top button?
  The button should maybe resemble the dark mode switch more?
* TODO List should have same spacing as blockquotes
  Numbered and bulleted lists should have the number/bullet have the same
  horizontal spacing as the left (colored) border of the blockquote.
* TODO On big screen: Put tables-of-content in sidebar
* TODO URL comments in CSS should be in docs
  The origin of various little tricks are given in CSS comments, but they
  should be in the docs file.
* TODO Test/verify Chrome scrollbar
* TODO References to `.img` in CSS?
  Possibly replace with `:has(img:only-child)`? Nope, won't work. `:only-child`
  matches as long as it is the only subelement, however, other text does not
  affect the match.

  E.g. `<td>lext <a href="...">link</a</td>` would be matched by td `a:only-link`.

** DONE Use `<p>` instead of `<h2>` for subtitle inside `<hgroup>`
   CLOSED: [2025-06-24 Tue 01:44]
   `<hgroup>` should not contain multiple headings, but only a single heading
   with optional preceding or following `<p>` tags, so the way we previously
   did this was wrong.

   The `<hgroup>` HTML element represents a heading and related content. It
   groups a single `<h1>`–`<h6>` element with one or more `<p>`.

** DONE Wrap each chapter (heading + text) in `<div>`
   CLOSED: [2025-06-24 Tue 05:59]
   Wrap each heading & its content in a `<div>` tag, moving the `id` attribute
   of the `<h#>` tag to the wrapping `<div>` instead. (This is so that a CSS
   `:target` can hilite the entire section instead of just the heading.)

   Originally the intent was to use `<section>` tags here, not `<div>` tags.
   But the `<section>` is fraught with troubles in most browsers (it'll
   currently modify the size of any `<h1>` inside of it, but also display a
   deprecation warning in the Firefox developers console).
** DONE Put only `www` directory + template file in Git
   CLOSED: [2025-06-24 Tue 11:07]
   Ideally one should be able to check the entirety of this repo out as a
   `www/` directory, and then copy an empty `template.html` file from there to
   start a new project.

   In this repo there should also be a Git commit hook script available (which
   is easily installable) which verifies that the `Update:` header has been
   updated when committing an HTML file.
** [12/12] Classes for indent modes
   It should be possible to wrap (e.g. the paragraphs of a glossary) in
   something like `<div class=hanging>` to get hanging indent for those
   paragraphs. Specifying `<p class=hanging>` for an individual paragraph
   should also work.

   What should the modes be called?

   Paragraph mode: There are three modes, controlled by the following HTML
   attributes. Is inherited, so you can wrap any number of paragraphs with a
   <div hanging>.

     'book'    -- separate paragraphs by indenting first line, except for first
                  paragraph (default)
     'blank'   -- separated by blank lines
     'hanging' -- hanging indent (default in tables)
     'contd'   -- continued hanging indent

  Should text in tables be indented according to the current indent mode?

    Variable names `--book-keep` and `--hanging-keep` are hard to understand.
    Rename these `--is-book` and `--is-hanging` and invert their logic. The `is`
    prefix makes it obvious that they are Boolean values, setting them to `1`
    (true) in respective mode is more intuitive than having the logic being
    inverted.
